				<h3>|---- VERSE 1 ----|</h3>
					I'm a lover <br>
					And a fighter, <br>
					I'm a paragon of pain. <br>
					<br>
					I need another <br>
					night beside her <br>
					To make it through the day. <br>
					<br>

				<h3>|---- Pre-Chorus 1 ----|</h3>
					To hold her tight <br>
					and make it right <br>
					Well that's the only way. <br>
					<br>

				<h3>|---- Chorus ----|</h3>
					Baby, wont you tell me <br>
					Everything you've ever known, <br>
					and Darling would you show me <br>
					Everything from head to toe <br>
					<br>
					Baby is it lonely? <br>
					a thousand miles from home? <br>
					Could I be your one and only? <br>
					Would you call be Romeo? <br>
					<br>
				
				<h3>|---- VERSE 2 ----|</h3>
					She's an angel <br>
					and a dreamer. <br>
					She's a paragon on love.
					<br>
					I wouldn't change her. <br>
					if you seen her <br>
					You'd never get enough <br>
					<br>

				<h3>|---- Pre-Chorus 2 ----|</h3>
					Cause the stars in the night <br>
					The Sun or it's light <br>
					Can simply not compare. <br>
				<br>

				<h3>|---- Chorus ----|</h3>
					Baby, wont you tell me <br>
					Everything you've ever known, <br>
					and Darling would you show me <br>
					Everything from head to toe <br>
					<br>
					Baby is it lonely? <br>
					a thousand miles from home? <br>
					Could I be your one and only? <br>
					Would you call be Romeo? <br>
					<br>

				<h3>|---- Instrumental ----|</h3>
					<br>

				<h3>|---- Alt Chorus ----|</h3>
					So Baby wont you tell me <br>
					Everywhere you want to go. <br>
					We could see the lights of Paris <br>
					To the Vatican in Rome. <br>
					<br>
					We could catch a flight to Vegas <br>
					Then set sail for Tokyo. <br>
					But Darling dont you worry <br>
					In my heart you'll find a home. <br>
					<br>
