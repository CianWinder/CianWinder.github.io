				|---- VERSE 1 ----|
				
                I still try to,
				realise what you
				meant when you said
				you'd never love again.
				
				The late nights have me
				paralysed from the
				memories. Im lost
				in thoughts of you and me.
				
				|---- VERSE 2 ----|
				
				And every word said
				gets stuck in my head.
				All the words I wish
				I never said to her.
				
				But I still try
				to find a new light
				to guide me, but
				you are all that I can see.
				
				|---- CODA ----|
				
				Cause you sound to me
				like a perfect meoldy.
				
				You're all I see
				in my favourite memories.
				
				Do you believe
				it was ever meant to be?
				
				Cause you seem to be
				such a vital part of me.
				
				So why'd you leave?
