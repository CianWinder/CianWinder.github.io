				<h3>|---- VERSE 1 ----|</h3>
                I still try to, <br>
				realise what you <br>
				meant when you said <br>
				you'd never love again. <br>
				<br>
				The late nights have me <br>
				paralysed from the <br>
				memories. Im lost <br>
				in thoughts of you and me. <br>
				<br>
				<h3>|---- VERSE 2 ----|</h3>
				And every word said <br>
				gets stuck in my head. <br>
				All the words I wish <br>
				I never said to her. <br>
				<br>
				But I still try <br>
				to find a new light <br>
				to guide me, but <br>
				you are all that I can see. <br>
				<br>
				<h3>|---- CODA ----|</h3>
				Cause you sound to me <br>
				like a perfect meoldy. <br>
				<br>
				You're all I see <br>
				in my favourite memories. <br>
				<br>
				Do you believe <br>
				it was ever meant to be? <br>
				<br>
				Cause you seem to be <br>
				such a vital part of me. <br>
				<br>
				So why'd you leave?<br>
